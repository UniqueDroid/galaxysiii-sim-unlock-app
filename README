TODO:

Current version has one known issue (not a big one) which is the secret code
*#7465625# popping up system "Personalization Status" tool only at second
attempt.


One missing feature is backup restoration and re-locking.
Thing is restoring from a backup stored on sdcard is unsafe by design, because
this backup could be altered by mistake or malicious tools.
Also, if something went wrong it might be a good idea to restore backups
manually after careful analyss, as you know, things are not not supposed
to go wrong with this app^^

Re-locking however is a trivial operation and shall be implemented if it's
a common feature request.


Of course you might have noticed that the app is ugly as hell.
This is kind of intended as people notice immediately it's a hacker tool
instead of a commercial polished solution they'll complain about to the author,
but if you feel like contributing with a beautiful yet simple UI.. why not!
